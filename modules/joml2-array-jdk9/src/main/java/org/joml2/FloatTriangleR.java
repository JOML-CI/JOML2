 * <p>
 * {@code equals} compares the components element-wise and bitwise, as by
 * {@code Float.floatToIntBits}: {@code 0.0} and {@code -0.0} are not equal, and NaN is equal to
 * NaN. {@code hashCode} is consistent with it (derived from the same bit patterns). Only instances
 * of this library's implementation compare equal to each other; the {@code equals} of a triangle
 * never returns {@code true} for an object of another type.
 * <p>
 * {@code equalsEpsilon} compares per component with a tolerance: an infinite component never
 * compares equal, not even to an equal infinity (the difference {@code Inf - Inf} is NaN), and a
